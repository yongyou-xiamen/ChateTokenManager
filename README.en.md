## What Is It

AIHelms is an AI resource management platform for enterprises. It helps companies **manage AI assets, control AI spend, and measure the value of AI**.

- **For leadership** — the platform records usage, calculates cost, and generates reports, so the return on your AI investment is visible.
- **For administrators** — onboard models, assign identities, and set budgets from a single admin console.
- **For employees** — get an AI identity from the user portal and use it with any client.

![Architecture](docs/struct.png)


## Why AIHelms

### Cost you can see and control

The biggest worry with enterprise AI is spending money without knowing where it goes. AIHelms builds a full cost model around that:

- **Dual pricing, internal and external** — external cost (what the provider charges) and internal settlement price (what you bill departments) are tracked separately. Pass cost through as-is, or add a markup for internal settlement.
- **Multi-dimensional budgets** — set budgets per person, department, project, or model, with soft limits (alerts) and hard limits (cut off on overspend).
- **Real-time attribution** — every call traces back to a specific person, department, project, and model, down to the token level.

### One identity, one entry point

- One AI identity (API key) per employee, one entry point to every AI resource.
- AI employees (in progress).

### AI value, quantified

- **Coverage** — department coverage, activation rate, model usage distribution.
- **Activity** — daily call volume, tokens per person, usage trends.
- **Cost efficiency** — department cost ranking, model cost-effectiveness, budget burn, internal vs. external cost gaps.
- **Efficiency reports** — generated weekly and monthly, with drill-down by department, project, and model.

### Security and audit

- Sensitive data detection.
- High-risk prompt interception.
- Admin action tracking.

### Centralized resource management

- **Model management** — onboard multiple providers behind one gateway, load-balance across deployments of the same model, support both OpenAI and Anthropic formats.
- **Skill & MCP** — register, approve, and distribute internal AI tools in one place.
- **Fine-grained permissions** — who can use which model, how much quota, and when it expires, all configurable.
